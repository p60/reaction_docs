# Reports

> You've created a survey and sent it out to whom you believe to be the perfect audience. Now what? Sometimes, what you're looking for is right on the surface and a simple auto-generated bar chart of responses is all you'll need. Other times, you need to utilize different tools to dig deeper, slice and dice, filter, add or remove fields, etc. Reporting in Reaction allows you to do all these things and more. 

### Reports Catalog

Similar to the Surveys Catalog, all of your reports are housed here. Each time you open a created survey a report will automatically be generated here with the same name. You can customize those reports as well as create a **custom report** with any question from any survey from scratch.

### Viewing Reports
To view or explore your report, simply click on the colored tile WHY THE PENCIL?.  If you've been so busy doing research that you don't see the report you're looking for, you can **search** by *"Name"* or by *"Question."*  Once you've found it, just click the tile. 

### Configuring Reports	
So, a survey triggered the creation of an accompanying report and you want to tweak it?  Find the report and click the cog. This will allow you to adjust the order of the questions, remove questions, or add questions to suit your needs

> The **Restrict Access To** dropdown allows you to limit access to this report to pre-configured groups. (These are created in "Settings" under **"Manage Access Groups"**).

### Creating Custom Reports

To create a **Custom Report** from scratch, simply click the ![hamburger button](https://s3.amazonaws.com/peer60_organizations/documentation+tbd/Icons/Hamburger+Nest+Icon.png "hamburger menu") in the top right and then the ![+ icon](https://s3.amazonaws.com/peer60_organizations/documentation+tbd/Icons/Create+Icon.png "add report"). At this point, you'll be brought to the "Configure Report" screen where you name your custom report and begin selecting questions to add. Follow the above example .gif.
