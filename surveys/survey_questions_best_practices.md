## Survey Best Practices

1. Analysis shows that the vast majority (90%+ plus) of individuals prefer to answer questions on their smartphone as opposed to doing so on their laptops. That being the case, participants should be able to answer all of your questions in ~60 seconds. There are, however, rare cases where initiatives can take 90 seconds or more to answer. If the target audience are your customers then you have more flexibility in posing longer question sets. If you are leveraging our network; however, there is very little flexibility in exceeding the 60 second guideline.
2. Since engagement is critical, and most people check their emails on their smartphones, keep your questions (and answer options) short and concise so as to not frustrate respondents.
3. Questions should be relevant and engaging to the titles you are targeting.
4. Open-ended questions are universally disliked by participants and as such should be utilized sparingly and, if possible, avoided.
