## Email Best Practices

 1. Subject lines should be short — 2 to 3 words at most — and should never contain the word ‘survey’.
 2. Do not use the word ‘survey’ anywhere in the content of your email.
 3. Keep your email content short.
	 * 3 sentences is ideal.
	 * Once you get past 5 sentences you are entering dangerous (read: delete email) territory.
	 * Analysis shows that long emails get deleted far more frequently than do shorter emails.
 4. Let the target audience know how many questions you are asking them about. If it’s 5 questions then state that clearly in your email message.
 5. Avoid marketing pitches and sales-speak in your email message – this will blow up in your face.
 6. Make your email messaging personal, and targeted to the audience. If you are targeting your customers, as opposed to the market in general, you need to make sure your messaging is personalized. Often, when selecting your target audience, some of your existing customers may be included. Be mindful of this when writing your emails and, if you prefer, you can craft a separate email for them altogether that reflects the existing relationship etc.
 7. Emails coming from individuals with VP or C-level titles receive higher response rates than those with Manager (and below titles). But if the email comes from someone with a sales title, the response rate will be low so avoid emails coming from anyone in a sales role.
	 *  If possible, create a realistic looking email alias. If your real email is jane.smith@company.com consider coming up with something like janesmith@company.com. This helps you better manage auto-responses and direct replies.
 8. 3 to 4 days after each email send, please forward all auto-reply emails and unsubscribe emails to unsubscribe@reactiondata.com. Your next round of messages will not be sent until these emails are processed. The easiest option for forwarding these emails are to simply highlight all the emails and attach them to one email that you send over to us.
