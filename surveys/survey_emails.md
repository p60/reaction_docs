#### Emails Tab
>Getting folks to participate in a survey, while trying to avoid using the word "survey" and adding to their already overflowing email inbox, is an art form. Grab your Bob Ross wig and start making some art.

To create 1 of your 3 email sends:

1. Click the orange + icon on the bottom right and select which email you'd like to create.
	1. The **"Survey Link"** type will be your most common email send. 
	2. If you're unsatisfied with the results after one send or just want to remind people you'll use the **"Survey Reminder."**
	3. If you're still unsatisfied after 2 sends, you can send the **"Last Call"** to give your audience one last chance to participate.
2. Select who you'd like it sent from by clicking the **"Email Configuration"** dropdown. These are created in  [Settings](../blob/master/NEEDTOSETUPCORRECTLINK) and are preconfigured combinations of the email address we want to send from, replies sent to, and an email signature; typically, the same one the sender always uses.
3. Add your Email **Subject**.
4. Add your Email **Body** while utilizing the **Insert Variable** tool. This allows you to add participant attributes (e.g. Dear "Participant First Name) and various ways to link the survey (e.g. Survey Link Button).
5. **Preview** your email by clicking the eyeball and sending it to your own email address. This is exactly as it will appear to recipients and is meant for you to note necessary changes and eventually give it the sign of approval. 
   *  Should you decide that one of your email drafts doesn't need to be sent or if you just want to start from scratch you can click the **"Delete"** button trash can on the bottom.
6. Once you've confirmed it is the way you want it, click **"Delivery Actions"** and select "Create Deliveries for Participants."
7. When you have a send schedule in mind click **"Delivery Actions"** again and select "Schedule Created Deliveries."
	1. To send it immediately (you procrastinator, you), you will toggle the "Schedule Delivery Time" off, read the dialogue letting you know that this is the point of no return as we can't unsend emails, click the "Ready" box, and "Deliver Email Messages."
	2. To schedule a future send, toggle the "Schedule Deliver Time" on, select the date and time you'd like this email to be sent out, read the dialogue letting you know that this is the point of no return as we can't un-send emails, click the "Ready" box, and "Deliver Email Messages."
