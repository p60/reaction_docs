If you're seeing this it means the world is ending and you should probably panic!](https://s3.amazonaws.com/peer60_organizations/documentation+tbd/Icons/add+email+icon.png "add email") on the bottom right and select which email you'd like to create.
	* The **"Survey Link"** type will be your first and most common email send WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THE NOTIFICATION?
	* If you're unsatisfied with the results after one send, or just want to remind people, you'll use the **"Survey Reminder."**
	* If you're still unsatisfied after 2 sends, you can send the **"Last Call"** to give your target audience one last chance to participate.

2. Select who you'd like it sent *from* by clicking the **"Email Configuration"** dropdown.  
	* These are created in  "Settings" and are preconfigured combinations of the email address we want to send from, email address (if different) you'd like replies sent to, and an email signature; typically the same one the sender always uses in and out of Reaction. *For instructions on how to create a new Email Configuration, search for "settings" in the help menu).*

3. Add your Email **Subject**.
4. Add your Email **Body** while utilizing the **Insert Variable** tool. This allows you to add participant attributes (e.g. Dear "Participant First Name) and various ways to link the survey (e.g. Survey Link or Begin Survey Link Button).
5. **Preview** your email by clicking the![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/peer60_organizations/documentation+tbd/Icons/preview+email.png "preview email") and sending it to your own email address. This is exactly as it will appear to recipients and is meant for you to note any necessary changes and eventually give it the sign of approval. 
   *  Should you decide that one of your email drafts doesn't need to be sent or if you just want to start from scratch you can **"Delete"** the email by clicking ![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/peer60_organizations/documentation+tbd/Icons/delete+email.png "delete email") on the bottom. (Note: once an email is scheduled you will not be able to delete it here. You will, however, be able to cancel any pending messages on the Deliveries page)
6. Once you've confirmed it is the way you want it, click **"Delivery Actions"** 

 >If you haven't done so already, **go back to the Survey Details tab** and click ![hamburger menu](https://s3.amazonaws.com/peer60_organizations/documentation+tbd/Icons/Hamburger+Nest+Icon.png) in the top right and open your survey. 

7. When you have a send schedule in mind, click **"Delivery Actions"** again and select "Schedule Created Deliveries."
	* **To send it immediately** (you procrastinator, you), you will toggle the "Schedule Delivery Time" off, read the dialogue letting you know that this is the point of no return as we can't unsend emails, click the "Ready" box, and "Deliver Email Messages."
	* **To schedule a future send**, toggle the "Schedule Delivery Time" on, select the date and time you'd like this email to be sent out, click the "I confirm that the delivery times listed above are correct" box, and "Schedule email messages for delivery." **(Scheduled email messages can be cancelled in the Deliveries tab)**
