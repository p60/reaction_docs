# Surveys

> Note: Before creating your survey, to make your life easier, we recommend adding/creating any new <a href="participants">participants</a> and <a href="groups">groups</a> that will be involved. You are unable to save a survey without completing the participant invitation field.

DEVS - HOW CAN WE BEST ADD "BEST PRACTICES" TO THE DOCUMENTATION? FORMATTING APPEARS LIMITED IN MARKDOWN BUT WE DON'T NECESSARILY WANT IT SEPARATED.

**Surveys**, the means you use to do your research with Reaction, are located on the left. This is where you'll go to see all your ongoing and completed surveys, as well as create news ones. 

If you're a first timer in Reaction, or you want just want to get down to business, you'll want to get straight to the creation process(add link to "configuring the survey") and click the ![](Insert + button here) in the top right corner. This will give you the option to create one of two types of surveys:

  * **NPS** is a classic Net Promoter Score Survey, with pre-generated questions to assure consistency (though additional questions are still an option).
  * **Freeform** is for anything and everything else. 
 
If you have any existing surveys, whether they're still being worked on ("Draft"), ongoing ("Open"), or completed ("Closed"), they'll be the colorful tiles like you see here:
