#### Questions Tab

>I picture a survey without good *Questions* as a dinner party without dinner. People show up hungry expecting food and instead they get a shpeel about their friend's new scented oil business that you should *totally* be a part of. Feed your friends and make them happy they came. They might just show up for the next one; and the one after that.

If you're seeing this it means the world is ending and you should probably panic!](https://s3.amazonaws.com/peer60_organizations/documentation+tbd/Main+Questions+Page.png "This will be a screenshot of the Questions section with annotation of each section.

##### Question Types

1. **Boolean (For Yes/No or True/False)** - "Yes" or "No", "True" or "False," "Always" or "Never;" life *is* in black and white in the land of Boolean.
2. **Multiple Choice Many (For "Select All That Apply" or "Select Multiple")** - Sometimes we don't want to know just one reason you love Justin Beiber. We know you have many.
3. **Multiple Choice (For Select One)** - Other times there might only be one possible answer for you to make, or maybe I'm a sadist and am forcing you to pick just one reason you're a Belieber. Don't you dare abuse the "Other" option with a list.
4. **Number Scale** - On a scale of 0-10 (0 being awful and 10 being fantastic) how helpful has this help doc been?
5. **Ranking** - 5, 4, 7, 6, 3, 2, 1. I just ranked the Star Wars films as of 2016. Easy. 
6. **Text (Open Ended Question)** - Sometimes the answer to a question shouldn't be pre-defined; nor should we always try to read a participant's mind. The answer to the ultimate question of life, the universe, and everything is occasionally more complicated than "42."

Some questions have additional options for customization...

##### Manage Conditions
>If Question 1 is: "Do you like pizza?" and they respond with: "No" then we don't want Question 2 to be "What are your favorite toppings?" We would want it to be something more along the lines of: "How do you live with yourself?" This is the essence of conditions. We create a flowchart of questions based on responses.

To create a new condition: 

1. Put all of your questions in the order you'd like them to appear to the participant before adding any conditions. Do this by clicking the up and down arrows to the far right of each question. **The order cannot be changed once you add conditions!**
2. To add a condition, click on the question that you want displayed *only* if certain conditions are met. 
3. Click on the orange hamburger button and select "manage conditions."
   1. Select the question that forms the condition (ex. I only want to ask "What are your favorite toppings?" to those who responded "yes" to the question "Do you like pizza?" "Do you like pizza?" is the question that forms the condition.)
   2. Using the "Operators" dropdown, select the correct operator to create the condition that needs to be met. (ex. "Do you Like Pizza?" equals "Yes") 
   3. At this point you will either click "Save" or you may add additional conditions and even conditions within conditions. It's like *Inception*, but for conditions. (*Inception 2: "They Thought Limbo Was The Deepest You Could Go"*)

**DO WE NEED TO DEFINE AND PROVIDE EXAMPLES OF EACH OPERATOR?**

##### Survey Preview
>Would Steve Jobs have shipped the Macintosh sight unseen? Like Michelangelo, you've crafted your David of a survey; and now you need to preview it. Previewing your survey lets you have the same experience your recipients will; check and double-check that everything is as it should be. 

To preview your survey:

1. On the questions tab, click the orange hamburger button and select preview.
2. Verify that each screen and condition are working and look as expected by clicking through it. At the end you have the option to Restart Preview and go through it again or you may just close the window.
