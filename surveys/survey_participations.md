### Participations Tab
>These Surveys don't take themselves! Clicking this seemingly insignificant button, in fact, creates a unique survey for each of your contacts!

To add participations to your survey:

1. Click "Create Participations For 'audience_name'"
2. That's it! Super anti-climactic, right? Maybe help yourself to a snack.

> Please note that if any contacts are added to your target audience after you've already created participations, you will need to create a participation for them as well by repeating this process.
