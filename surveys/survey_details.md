#### Details Tab

![This was supposed to be a screenshot. If you're seeing this it means the world is ending and you should probably panic!](https://s3.amazonaws.com/peer60_organizations/documentation+tbd/Survey+Details+-+Part+1.png "This will be a screenshot of the Details section with annotation of each section. Survey Details Tab - Part 1")

1. **Configure Survey** - This is the important stuff.
   1. Every Survey needs a name! This is not visible to the participants so feel free to get creative. For organizational purposes, you may want to include **“| month year”** after the name. Ex: **"Revenue Cycle | May 2015"** 
   2.  Describe your survey. What are your goals? What do you hope to achieve by asking the questions you'll soon be creating? What is the meaning of the universe? Keep in mind, you, or someone else entirely, could be coming back to this in a year or more.
   3.  NEED MORE INFO ON TAGS
2. **Participant Invitation** - How do you want your survey to be distributed? (We're working on the "by owl" option.)
   1. "Is Trigger Based?" or — "if this happens, then do that" — will allow you to send a survey automatically when a case is closed in Salesforce.  NEED TO DOUBLE CHECK THIS. ADD LINK TO TRIGGERS DOC.
   2.  The "Participant Group" dropdown will be where you select the pre-configured audience you want to reach. (You did read the note at the beginning that told you to create a group before you got to this point, right? If not, click here **ADD LINK** to learn how to create groups.) **Remember**, you can't choose a different *Participant Group* once you've saved your survey.
3. **Design Settings** - We don't want to distract from the research; but here's your chance to make things a teensy bit flashy.
   1. If you're using Reaction, chances are you know someone who has created a logo, even if you haven't yourself. Show it off! (If you haven't added your logo yet, click here **ADD LINK**)
   2. The "Admin Color" can be used to organize surveys in a visual way or, it could be a rare opportunity to choose your favorite color while you're getting paid for it.
