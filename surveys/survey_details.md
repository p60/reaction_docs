#### Details Tab

> Whenever you're ready to open your survey to your participants **(Note: This is a requirement before scheduling emails)** come back to this page, click the ![hamburger menu](https://s3.amazonaws.com/peer60_organizations/documentation+tbd/Icons/Hamburger+Nest+Icon.png) in the top right, schedule, and follow the instructions!

**Configure Survey** - The devil is in the details.

   1. Every Survey needs a name! This is not visible to the participants so feel free to get creative. For organizational purposes, you may want to include **“| month year”** after the name. Ex: **"Revenue Cycle | May 2015"** 
   2.  Don't pester people with questions without a good reason! What are your goals? **What are you trying to learn from the results of your survey?** What is the meaning of the universe? Knowing what direction you need to go will help as you develop questions and compose emails. Also keep in mind, you, or someone else entirely, could be coming back to this in a year or more. Even more reason to use the often ignored "description" field!
   3.  Tagging allows you to create additional markers to a survey for future searches. These are a descriptor that provide another way to search for similar Surveys in both the Survey Catalog and when creating custom reports. **If I want to create a relationship between two or more surveys that I want to later browse for trends or correlations using a custom report I might tag them** (e.g. Comic-Con 2015 and Comic-Con 2016 might have a "comic-con" tag).

**Participant Invitation** - How do you want your survey to be distributed? (We're working on the "by owl" option a la Harry Potter)

   1. "Is Trigger Based?" or — "if this happens, then do that" — will allow you to send a survey automatically when a case is closed in Salesforce.  *(For instructions on how to build triggers, search for "triggers overview" in the help menu).*
   2.  The "Participant Group" dropdown will be where you select the pre-configured audience you want to reach. *(For instructions on how to build a participant group, search for "groups overview" in the help menu).*.

**Design Settings** - We don't want to distract from the research, but here's your chance to make things a teensy bit flashy.

   1. If you're using Reaction, chances are you know someone who has created a logo, even if you haven't yourself. Show it off! *(For instructions on how to add a logo, search for "logo" in the help menu).*   
   2. The "Admin Color" can be used to organize surveys in a visual way or, it could be a rare opportunity to choose your favorite color while you're getting paid for it. 
   3. THERE WILL BE AN ADDITIONAL DESIGN SETTINGS PAGE TBD - DANNY, IGNORE.

1. **Completion Page Custom Content** - So you have something you want to say to your participants? A "thank you" or a "now what?" fits perfectly here. (e.g. "Thank you for participating! As a 'thank you' we've shared your peers' responses to one of the questions here!" OR "If you have any additional questions please reach out to your account manager."
2. **NPS Options** - DANNY, JUST PUT IN GIBBERISH HERE

1. **Shared Visualization** -   It's not just you that is curious what your peers think! As an incentive, out of the goodness of your heart, for whatever reason, you're able to choose to share the results of a question (or two or three) with your participants. Just let your myprojects team know which data you'd like to share...
2. Here is an example of where your **Completion Page Custom Content** will show up at the end of a survey. 
DO WE MOVE THIS SCREENSHOT TO A DIFFERENT DOC? IF WE'RE GOING TO HAVE SHARED VIZ INVISIBLE TO ALL BUT SUPER ADMINS IT MIGHT FIT BETTER SOMEWHERE ELSE.
