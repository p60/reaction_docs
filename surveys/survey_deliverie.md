#### Deliveries Tab
>Have you ever asked yourself "are people even getting these things I send? I haven't been getting any 'Thank You' cards so how can I be sure?" Enter the **Deliveries** Tab.

To check the status on a particular person, just click on ![Search](https://s3.amazonaws.com/peer60_organizations/documentation+tbd/Icons/Search+Icon.png) and choose which field you'd like to search by. Otherwise, you're able to scroll through and verify the status of your deliveries.
