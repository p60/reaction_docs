# Help

>**Help**, we all need it sometimes. Some of us are more proud to ask someone for it than others. Some of us work odd hours. Some of us like to figure things out on our own. You can always ask us here at peer60 for help; but if you fit one of the above descriptions, then you should know that **help** is never very far away.

 When you find yourself needing help, you'll almost always have at least two options.

Option 1: ![screenshot of nav bar "help" button](placeholder.jpg) is always on the left side of the screen. If you're reading this, you found it already and you can find it again. Once you're there, it's as simple as clicking the ![hamburger](hamburger_menu.jpg) on the top right and finding what you're looking for by scrolling or searching.

Option 2: ![pic of help icon](help.jpg) is found on most pages and clicking on it will take you directly to help related to the page you're currently on.
