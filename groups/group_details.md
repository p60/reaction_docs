##Adding Contacts to an Audience

>You can always add and remove contacts to and from an audience; quite unlike the attendees of your family reunion.

### Filtering Contacts

> Imagine for a moment you could filter the attendees of your family reunion. (Don't get too caught up in this example, it's hypothetical). Maybe you only want the interesting ones, or the one's with good personal hygiene.  I know I like Aunt Margo's jokes and Uncle Buck's ribs. **Filtering Contacts** allows you to create a group that fits your specific needs.

1. To begin filtering out contacts for your audience click the ![Search Button](https://s3.amazonaws.com/peer60_organizations/documentation+tbd/Icons/Search+Icon.png)
2. Choose the criteria you want for this audience by using the dropdowns (e.g. If you'd like to add every contact with the title of "CEO" you would 
	* FILTER BY: "Position Name" 
	* COMPARES: "Equals" 
	* VALUE:  "CEO" 
3. At this point, you have a few choices depending on your goals.
	* Add additional filters by clicking "Add Filter" (e.g. CEO OR Chief Executive Officer OR Chief Executive, CEO AND CFO AND COO). 
	* Confirm your filter criteria and begin your search by clicking "Apply Filters."
	* Or, start your filter criteria from scratch by clicking "Clear Filters."
4. Select from the, now filtered, eligible contacts by clicking the check boxes to the left of each person. There is a "select all" check box at the top of the column. 
5. Click "Add Selected" to finish adding contacts to the audience. 

Removing contacts from your audience is done in the same way.
