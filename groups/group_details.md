#### Adding Participants to a Group

>You can always add and remove participants to and from a group; quite unlike the attendees of your family reunion.

> If you've just created a new group, or you've clicked the ![Edit pencil](https://octodex.github.com/images/yaktocat) next to an existing group, this page will be the same.

1. Click the ![Search Button](https://octodex.github.com/images/yaktocat)
2. Begin filtering from your list of participants by the criteria you want for this group (e.g. If you'd like to add every participant with the title of "CEO" you would 
	* FILTER BY: "Position Name" 
	* COMPARES: "Equals" 
	* VALUE:  "CEO" 
3. At this point, you have a few choices depending on your goals.
	* Add additional filters by clicking "Add Filter" (e.g. CEO OR Chief Executive Officer OR Chief Executive, CEO AND CFO AND COO).
	* Confirm your filter criteria and begin your search by clicking "Apply Filters."
	* Start your filter criteria from scratch by clicking "Clear Filters."
4. Select from the, now filtered, eligible participants by clicking the check boxes to the left of each person. There is a "select all" check box at the top of the column.
5. Click "Add Selected" to finish adding participants to the group.
