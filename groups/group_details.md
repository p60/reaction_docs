### Adding Participants to a Group

>You can always add and remove participants to and from a group; quite unlike the attendees of your family reunion.

#### Filtering Participants

> Imagine for a moment you could filter the attendees of your family reunion. (Don't get too caught up in this example, it's hypothetical). Maybe you only want the interesting ones, or the one's with good personal hygiene.  I know I like Aunt Margo's jokes and Uncle Buck's ribs. **Filtering Participants** allows you to create a group that fits your specific needs. Selfish? Maybe; but effective!

1. To begin filtering out participants for your group click the ![Search Button](https://octodex.github.com/images/yaktocat)
2. Choose the criteria you want for this group by using the dropdowns (e.g. If you'd like to add every participant with the title of "CEO" you would 
	* FILTER BY: "Position Name" 
	* COMPARES: "Equals" 
	* VALUE:  "CEO" 
3. At this point, you have a few choices depending on your goals.
	* Add additional filters by clicking "Add Filter" (e.g. CEO OR Chief Executive Officer OR Chief Executive, CEO AND CFO AND COO).
	* Confirm your filter criteria and begin your search by clicking "Apply Filters."
	* Or, start your filter criteria from scratch by clicking "Clear Filters."
4. Select from the, now filtered, eligible participants by clicking the check boxes to the left of each person. There is a "select all" check box at the top of the column.
5. Click "Add Selected" to finish adding participants to the group.
