# Help

>**Help**, we all need it sometimes. Some of us are more proud to ask someone for it than others. Some of us like to figure things out on our own. You can always ask us here at Reaction for help; but if you fit one of the above descriptions, then you should know that **help** is never very far away.

 When you find yourself needing help, you'll almost always have at least two options.

**Option 1**: ![This was supposed to be a screenshot. If you're seeing this it means the world is ending and you should probably panic!](https://s3.amazonaws.com/peer60_organizations/documentation+tbd/knowledgebase/help+button+updated.png) is always on the left side of the screen. If you're reading this, you found it already and you can find it again. Once you're there, it's as simple as clicking the ![This was supposed to be a screenshot.

**Option 2**: ![This was supposed to be a screenshot. If you're seeing this it means the world is ending and you should probably panic!](https://s3.amazonaws.com/peer60_organizations/documentation+tbd/Icons/Help.png "Help Icon") is found in various places throughout the platform. Often it will take you right to the help you're looking for. 

**Option 3**: Sometimes the help icon ![This was supposed to be a screenshot.
