# Contacts

> Note: Due to the sensitive nature of the peer60 community, as of 11/11/2016 peer60 will still be compiling the list of participants by title or other criteria you'd like to reach out to. 

**Contacts** houses all of the individuals you can send a survey to (excluding the peer60 community). Whenever a survey link is clicked on, a participant is prompted to verify key information including: Name, Company Name, Position Name, and Postal Code. This ensures participant data is current.
