# Participants

> Note: Due to the sensitive nature of the peer60 community, as of 10/3/2016 peer60 will still be compiling the list of participants by title or other criteria you'd like to reach out to. 

___

**Participants** houses all of the individuals you can send a survey to (excluding the peer60 community). Whenever a survey link is clicked on, a participant is prompted to verify key information including: Name, Company Name, Position Name, and Postal Code. This ensures participant data is current.

DEVS - WHEN AND HOW DOES A CLIENT SEE PARTICIPANT DATA FROM OUR COMMUNITY? WILL THEY SEE CONTACT INFO AFTER A RESPONSE? IF SO, WILL THAT PERSON BE MOVED TO THEIR PARTICIPANTS AS THEY NOW HAVE THEIR INFO ANYWAY? 


![This was supposed to be a screenshot. If you're seeing this it means the world is ending and you should probably panic!](https://s3.amazonaws.com/peer60_organizations/documentation+tbd/participants+page.png "Participants Page")

1. Add new participants individually or in bulk.
2. Search by (First Name, Last Name, Company Name, Position Name, Role, or Seniority)
3. View participant's info.

THE PENCIL IS A BIT MISLEADING AS YOU CAN'T EDIT THE PARTICIPANT.

WHAT IS THE REASONING BEHIND NOT ALLOWING THEM TO EDIT INFO? I'M SURE IT'S A GOOD ONE BUT I KNOW THIS QUESTION WILL COME UP.

WHEN ADDING THE "INVALID DETAILS" WHAT DOES THIS DO? WHO IS NOTIFIED, IF ANYONE, AND WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?

#### Adding a New Participant

![This was supposed to be a screenshot. If you're seeing this it means the world is ending and you should probably panic!](https://s3.amazonaws.com/peer60_organizations/documentation+tbd/add+participant.gif "This will be a gif of the process to add a new participant... experiment speeding up the video a bit for typing in the actual data")

1. Click the grey hamburger in the top right.
2. Click the ![White + Button](https://octodex.github.com/images/yaktocat)
3. Fill in all the participant info.
4. Click "Save Participant."
5. Confirm that everything is correct as **only the participant will be able to update their information** and, if it is, click "Yes, create participant."

WHAT IS THE EXTERNAL ID? 
PC PRINCIPAL SAYS TO ADD THE GENDER "OTHER"


#### Importing Participants

>Reaction uses .csv for uploading your list of participants. For an example list and to ensure correct formatting, you can download an example .csv file by clicking the "Import Participants" button and ![Download Example CSV Button](https://octodex.github.com/images/yaktocat)

![This was supposed to be a screenshot. If you're seeing this it means the world is ending and you should probably panic!](http://ima.gs/Placeholder-400x200.png "This will be a gif of the process to import participants...")

1. Click the grey hamburger in the top right.
2. Click the ![Import Button](https://octodex.github.com/images/yaktocat)
3. Drop your list or click anywhere in the "Drop List Here" panel and select the correct file.
4. Confirm that all of the data from the import looks correct. By default, all participants are selected. WHY WOULD I UNSELECT? IS IT EASIER TO GO FIX THE ENTRY IN THE CSV AND THEN REUPLOAD OR UNSELECT AND THEN CREATE A WHOLE NEW CSV TO UPLOAD THE ONE THAT NEEDS FIXING?
5. Click the ![Orange Save Button](https://octodex.github.com/images/yaktocat). If any of your records have incompatible data in each respective field you will get an ![Status Error Icon](https://octodex.github.com/images/yaktocat) instead of a ![Complete Status Icon](https://octodex.github.com/images/yaktocat). Hovering over that status will give the error details or you can download the results by clicking ![Orange Download Button](https://octodex.github.com/images/yaktocat)

WHERE IS THE 'STREET ADDRESS' FROM THE EXAMPLE AND SHOULD WE CHANGE THAT TO ZIP CODE? 

LOCALE IS NOT A PARTICULARLY INTUITIVE FOR LANGUAGE. SHOULD WE ADD SOME OTHER HELP TEXT TO THE DOWNLOAD FILE TO MAKE IT MORE CLEAR?

WHEN DOES IT SKIP?

#### Searching Participants

Should you need to search for a participant to confirm they're in your Participant database or verify their information, simply click on the ![Orange Download Button](https://octodex.github.com/images/yaktocat) and select the criteria by which you'd like to search.
