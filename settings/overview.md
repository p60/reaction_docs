>The important stuff that you hope to touch as infrequently as possible.

#### Organization Details

![This was supposed to be a screenshot. If you're seeing this it means the world is ending and you should probably panic!](https://s3.amazonaws.com/peer60_organizations/documentation+tbd/settings_overview/organization%2Bdetails%2B-%2Bsettings.png)

1. Organization Display Name - We like flexibility, and not just at our company yoga retreats. So we want you to be able to swap your displayed (i.e. viewed by recipients) name at any time to fit your needs. TREVOR IS VERIFYING THIS. ALSO, EXAMPLES OF WHEN THIS MIGHT BE GOOD?

2. Organization Name - When you don't use a logo your Organization name will appear in it's place.  (i.e. order of what survey participant sees: Logo, [if there is no logo] Organization Display Name, [if there is no Org. Display Name] Organization Name)

3. Time Zone - WHAT DOES THIS IMPACT? JUST THE TIME YOU SEND EMAILS? (ask jason)
4. File Management - This is where you upload your logo. (DEVS, ANY PLANS TO ADD FUNCTIONALITY HERE? MANAGE IMAGES IS PRETTY BROAD IF IT'S ONLY LOGOS) (ask Jason)

#### Managing Users and Access Groups

3. Select the **Role** of the new user. 
	* Staff - DEFINE ME PLEASE

REMIND CASSIDY THIS IS NOW A GIF

##### Add a new Access Group or edit an existing one

>**Access Groups** allow you to create *groups* that are later granted *access* to the reports they need to see or blacklist them from the ones they don't. Restricting the access to a certain report is explained ADD LINK here.

![This was supposed to be a screenshot. If you're seeing this it means the world is ending and you should probably panic!](https://s3.amazonaws.com/peer60_organizations/documentation+tbd/settings_overview/Add+a+new+Access+Group.png)

1. Type in the name of the access group. Ex. Customer Research - Product A
2. Type in and select the names of those users you want Whitelisted or Blacklisted (NEED MORE INFO ON WHY HAVE BOTH. IF I'M NOT IN THE WHITELIST CAN WE ASSUME I'M BLACKLISTED? IS THERE MORE TO THIS?) (Trevor and I discovered that if you're blacklisted you're not able to even see the report)

#### Email Configurations

>Depending on your audience you may want to change who the email is coming from. **Email Configurations** allow you create a template to easily access the email address you'd like to send from, be replied to, and the individual's email signature. 


![This was supposed to be a screenshot. If you're seeing this it means the world is ending and you should probably panic!](https://s3.amazonaws.com/peer60_organizations/documentation+tbd/settings_overview/Email+Configurations.png)

1. Name (not shown to recipients) - This is the name of the configuration. Not necessarily the name of the person in the template. DO I UNDERSTAND THIS CORRECTLY? (from trevor: yes, yes you do. we'll need new screenshots as changes are forthcoming as of 9/28)
2. From Name - This IS the  name of the person the email should appear to be sent from.
3. From Email + domain - TREVOR AND I WILL DISCUSS THIS MORE IN DEPTH LATER.
4. Reply To Address - This is the email (not necessarily the same as "From") that all responses will go to. 
5. Signature - Using HTML (peer60 can help with this), recreate the email signature of the sender. TREVOR IS GOING TO CLARIFY FOR THE USER THAT HTML IS SUPPORTED. PROVIDE AN EXAMPLE HERE IN DOCUMENTATION
