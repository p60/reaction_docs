>The important stuff that you hope to touch as infrequently as possible.

### Organization Details

![This was supposed to be a screenshot. If you're seeing this it means the world is ending and you should probably panic!](https://s3.amazonaws.com/peer60_organizations/documentation+tbd/settings_overview/organization%2Bdetails%2B-%2Bsettings.png)

1. Organization Display Name - We like flexibility, and not just at our company yoga retreats. So we want you to be able to swap your displayed (i.e. viewed by recipients) name at any time to fit your needs. Want to have a product or department name for a particular survey? No problem.

2. Organization Name - When you don't use a logo your Organization name will appear in it's place.  (i.e. order of what survey participant sees: Logo, [if there is no logo] Organization Display Name, [if there is no Org. Display Name] Organization Name)

3. Time Zone 
4. File Management - This is where you'll upload any logo(s) you might use for a survey. 

### Managing Users and Access Groups

![This was supposed to be a screenshot. If you're seeing this it means the world is ending and you should probably panic!](https://s3.amazonaws.com/peer60_organizations/documentation+tbd/settings_overview/manage%2Busers%2Band%2Bgroups%2B-%2Bsettings.png)

1. Add a new Reaction User
2. Add a new Access Group (Access Groups are used to limit what data is visible to certain groups)
3. Manage Reaction Users - Edit existing permissions, roles, and other user info
4. Manage Access Groups - Edit White and Blacklist users for certain reports.

#### Add a new Reaction User
![This was supposed to be a screenshot. If you're seeing this it means the world is ending and you should probably panic!](http://www.findinglaurie.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Placeholder-400x200.png "This will be a gif of the process")

1. Add the **First Name**, **Last Name**, and **Email** of the new user.
2. The org admin determines the password at time of user creation. The user can then edit their password at any time.
3. Select the **Role** of the new user. 
	* Staff - DEFINE ME PLEASE
	* Admin - DEFINE ME PLEASE
	* Organization Admin -  DEFINE ME PLEASE
4. Each **Role** has pre-configured conditions. These can be customized on a user by user basis by clicking **Permissions**.


#### Add a new Access Group or edit an existing one

>**Access Groups** allow you to create *groups* that are later granted *access* to the reports they need to see or blacklist them from the ones they don't. 

![This was supposed to be a screenshot. If you're seeing this it means the world is ending and you should probably panic!](https://s3.amazonaws.com/peer60_organizations/documentation+tbd/settings_overview/Add+a+new+Access+Group.png)

1. Type in the name of the access group. Ex. Customer Research - Product A
2. Type in and select the names of those users you want Whitelisted or Blacklisted. (If you are part of a group that is Blacklisted, you will not even see the report[s])

### Email Configurations

>Depending on your audience you may want to change who the email is coming from. **Email Configurations** allow you create a template to easily access the email address you'd like to send from, be replied to, and the individual's email signature. 


![This was supposed to be a screenshot. If you're seeing this it means the world is ending and you should probably panic!](https://s3.amazonaws.com/peer60_organizations/documentation+tbd/settings_overview/Email+Configurations.png)

1. Name (not shown to recipients) - This is the name of the configuration. Not necessarily the name of the person in the template. (i.e. you may have a email config name for anything going out relating to Product A)
2. From Name - This IS the  name of the person the email should appear to be sent from.
3. From Email + domain - the email username is anything before the @ symbol. peer60 adds any email domains you intend to send from. 
4. Reply To Address - This is the email (not necessarily the same as "From") that all responses will go to. 
5. Signature - Using HTML (peer60 can help with this), recreate the email signature of the sender. 

### Email Display Settings
