# SmartData

> SmartData is market data acquired using the Reaction Platform by us, the Reaction team. To save you from having to take the time and effort duplicating our research we've compiled the data in ways we believe will help answer many of your questions. Sure, we charge you for access, but imagine having to do all of this yourself! I also need $ for a new bike.

> With SmartData, instead of starting on the opposing goal line, you're 40, 60, or 80 yards closer to your goal with minimal effort. Heck, you might even make it to the end zone just by opening up SmartData. <a href="https://www.reactiondata.com/suppliers/smartdata/#" target="_blank">Here</a> is a more in-depth rundown of SmartData and what it can do for you.

## SmartData is Compiled into Reports

## Navigating SmartData Reports

> Similar to how our super smart data monkeys have created default dashboards for each question type, they've also spent a lot of time compiling data the Reaction Team has acquired using this very platform. They've done their best to create digestible pages and visualizations to help answer your questions without having to ask them yourselves!

> On those occassions where you feel like the answers to your questions are hidden in the raw data and our monkeys haven't been able to sufficiently read your mind, let your Account Manager know. He/She will walk you through some options on how to proceed.
