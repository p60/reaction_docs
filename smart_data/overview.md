# SmartData

> SmartData is market data acquired using the Reaction Platform by us, the Reaction team. To save you from having to take the time and effort duplicating our research we've compiled the data in ways we believe will help answer many of your questions. Sure, we charge you for access, but imagine having to do all of this yourself! I also need $ for a new bike. 

> With SmartData, instead of starting on the opposing goal line, you're 40, 60, or 80 yards closer to your goal with minimal effort. Heck, you might even make it to the end zone just by opening up SmartData. <a href="https://www.reactiondata.com/suppliers/smartdata/#" target="_blank">Here</a> is a more in-depth rundown of SmartData and what it can do for you.

## SmartData is Compiled into Reports

#### From the SmartData Home Page you can access data in 1 of 3 ways:

1. **Create New Report** - Create a custom report from scratch pulling in any raw SmartData you're subscribed to by clicking the <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/peer60_organizations/documentation+tbd/Icons/Create+Icon.png" alt="This was supposed to be a screenshot. If you're seeing this it means the world is ending and you should probably panic!" width="3%" height="3%">
2. **View a Report** - View and explore an existing SmartData report as it was created by the Reaction SmartData Team by clicking on the tile
3. **Copy a Report** -  Copy an existing SmartData report for a common starting point before customizing (i.e. add and/or remove data, pages, and visualizations to fit your needs)



## Creating Custom SmartData Reports

### Copying a SmartData Report
> Maybe you want to tweak the pages and visualizations of an existing report. Maybe the Reaction Team didn't do it as well as you can (you cheeky bugger). Copying an existing SmartData Report will give you a jumpstart in getting you where you want to be.

1. **Copy Button** - Copy the report that fits your needs by clicking the copy button.
2. **Report Name** - Give this copied report a name (You can change this later).
3. **Configure Report** - A copied report gives you a starting point identical to it's parent report. Configuring the report allows you to truly make it custom by adding and removing pages and visualizations. There's a section just on configuration below.

### Creating a New SmartData Report

> Before you start creating SmartData Reports from scratch you'll want to be familiar with the data available to you.

1. **Name your Custom Report**
2. **Restrict Access To** - this allows you to limit who can see this report to members of groups you've created in Settings.
3. **Pages in your report** - You can add, copy, and delete pages in your report and see them listed here. (**Configuring a Report** will go into more details on this)
