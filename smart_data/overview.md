# SmartData

> SmartData is market data acquired using the Reaction Platform by us, the Reaction team. To save you from having to take the time and effort duplicating our research we've compiled the data in ways we believe will help answer many of your questions. Sure, we charge you for access, but imagine having to do all of this yourself! Now instead of starting on the opposing goalline, you're 40, 60, or 80 yards closer to your goal with minimal effort. Heck, you might even score just by opening up SmartData. <a href="https://www.reactiondata.com/suppliers/smartdata/#" target="_blank">Here</a> is a more in-depth rundown of SmartData.
