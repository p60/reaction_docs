# Configuring a SmartData Report

> A fully configured report consists of one or many pages, and pages of one or many visualizations. The Reaction Team has configured many SmartData Reports like the one below. Use it as an example of what not to do (just kidding).

>Similar to how you can copy an entire report to get a good starting point, you'll also notice below that you can do the same with pages and visualizations.
