# Configuring a SmartData Report

> A fully configured report consists of one or many pages, and pages of one or many visualizations. The Reaction Team has configured many SmartData Reports like the one below. Use it as an example of what not to do (just kidding, we do this a lot).
>
>Similar to how you can copy an entire report to get a good starting point, you'll also notice below that you can do the same with pages and visualizations. This can also save you some work and give you more time for sudoku.

### Adding Pages By Question

> Adding a page by question will do a few things for you: **it will automatically add the default dashboard as a visualization** (a group of visualizations) for the type of question your question is (e.g. multiple choice, ranking, etc), it will automatically filter all additional visualizations you add by the question's unique id, and it will name the page by the question (i.e. page name = question name)
>
> NOTE: Adding by a specific question will always be more limiting than adding by a question type as you're automatically filtering out all other questions. This means no combining similar questions, their results, etc.

### Adding Pages By Question Type

> **This is your visualization blank slate.** It really doesn't matter what Question Type you select here as you can easily change it in the bottom right of the New Visualization screen. With a blank slate you can pull from any survey, question, participant demographic(de-identified), etc. that Reaction has ever done*.
