# Configuring a SmartData Report

> A fully configured report consists of one or many pages, and pages of one or many visualizations. The Reaction Team has configured many SmartData Reports like the one below. Use it as an example of what not to do (just kidding, we do this a lot).
>
>Similar to how you can copy an entire report to get a good starting point, you'll also notice below that you can do the same with pages and visualizations. This can also save you some work and give you more time for sudoku.

### Adding Pages By Question

> Adding a page by question will do a few things for you: 
> 1. It will **automatically add the default dashboard** as your "visualization" (a default dashboard is a group of visualizations) for the type of question your question is (e.g. multiple choice, ranking, etc)
> 2. It will automatically **filter** all additional visualizations you add by the question's unique id
> 3. It will **name the page** by the question (i.e. page name = question name)
>
> NOTE: Adding by a specific question will always be more limiting than adding by a question type as you're automatically filtering out all other questions. This means no combining similar questions, their results, etc.

### Adding Pages By Question Type

> **This is your visualization blank slate.** It really doesn't matter what Question Type you select here as you can easily change it in the bottom right of the New Visualization screen. With a blank slate you can pull from any survey, question, participant demographic(de-identified), etc. that Reaction has ever done*.

### Adding Visualizations to a Page

> A visualization is the result of a combination of filters, dimensions, and measures that extrapolates (got my word of the day) answers to your questions; including ones you never knew you had. The raw data has mountains of information; but until we filter, select applicable dimensions and measures, and visualize the data, we will never find the value of it.

**To start building your visualization, follow these steps:**

1. Select "Add New Visualization" on the configuration screen.
2. Select one or more of the grey fields (called dimensions) to group your data. It will turn white when selected.
3. Select one or more of the orange fields (called measures) to add information about those groups, such as totals and counts.
4. In this example, we added a second measure.
5. Click **Filter**, if desired, to add a filter to your report based on that field.
6. Set the condition for any filters you've added.
7. If desired, choose a visualization type, such as a pie chart in this case. You can click on the gear menu in the upper right of the visualization section to customize your chart.
8. Click **Run**.
9. Rename and **Save** your visualization. You will now see this on it's applicable page and can add additional visualizations as needed.
